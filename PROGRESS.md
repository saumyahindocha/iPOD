**Done**
- Settled on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (Bluetooth Classic for A2DP), replacing the earlier ESP32-S3 plan
- Display, touch and PCM5102 DAC wired on the breadboard
- Chose the "Poster" Now Playing layout: full-bleed album art fading into an accent colour

**Fixed**
- Display RESET and touch T_DO were swapped: RESET is now GP21 and T_DO is GP20
- Display SDO/MISO left disconnected so it doesn't fight the touch controller on the shared bus

**Next**
- Get Bluetooth A2DP streaming working from the phone to the DAC
- Bring up the display and touch
- Buy a microSD card for the local playback track
